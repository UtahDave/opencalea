OpenCALEA tap TODO

-- change to use df_collector interface

-- re-impliment always dropping root privs once some install
documentation covers that

-- remove "-f" flag, and use all remaining commandline args
(after getopt) as the filter

-- target design for running as root and changing uid asap
(though support running as a user with appropriate capabilities).
ultimately collector should run as non-root, with tap setuid.
