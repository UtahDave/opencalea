OpenCALEA collector TODO

- rename to "cmd_collector" or something more self-descriptive

- create a method to invoke other commands beside tap(8)
  (or rename to "tap_collector", and make similar "collector"
   programs for other CmII/CmC agents)

- better command parsing

- fix process monitoring (eg. if a tap(8) exits/dies, need
  to catch that and clean up the process list)

- implement authentication for controller!!
