ABOUT:

  OpenCALEA is a project intiated by Merit Network Inc. whose goal is
to develop simple OpenSource based tools that can help the Internet
Service Provider community to meet their CALEA compliance needs.  Some
work towards sip voip support is also being done.

  Merely downloading and installing OpenCALEA will NOT make you CALEA
compliant.  CALEA includes administrative / procedural requirements
that can not be accomplished by simply executing a program.  Even to
use OpenCALEA as a component of your overall CALEA compliance requires
an understanding of, and often modification to your physical network,
and integration with various services you may run.

STATUS:

  OpenCALEA is a very young project and constantly changing.  Anything
from command names, invocation arguments and syntax, and even core
design are currently in flux.  Expect, but please report, bugs.

STANDARDS:

  OpenCALEA is currently working to impliment ATIS-1000013.2007,
Lawfully Authorized Electronic Surveillance (LAES) for Internet Access
and Services.

    https://www.atis.org/docstore/product.aspx?id=22665
      (currently a pre-published draft proposed ANSI standard)

  OpenCALEA sip support follows ATIS-PP-1000678.2006,
Lawfully Authorized Electronic Surveillance (LAES) for Voice over
Packet Technologies in Wireline Telecommunications Networks, Version 2.
