 * This type differs from the standard ENUMERATED in that it is modelled using
 * the fixed machine type (long, int, short), so it can hold only values of
 * limited length. There is no type (i.e., NativeEnumerated_t, any integer type
 * will do).
 * This type may be used when integer range is limited by subtype constraints.
